This week we were to work in a mighty group of four, combining front-end display and interactivity, with backend management of inputs and data, making use of Node,js, Express and SQL.

### Objectives

There were many sections to this weeks project:

- **Design and Planning**: Create wireframes and plan the layout and functionality of your web application.
- **Front-End Development**: Develop the user interface with HTML and CSS, focusing on a responsive and intuitive design.
- **Interactivity**: Implement dynamic content on the front end using vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
- **Back-End Development**: Build a server with Express that handles HTTP requests and communicates with a SQLite database.
- **Database Integration**: Design a database and use SQLite to store, update, and retrieve data efficiently using SQL queries.
- **Collaboration**: Work as a team to design and build a web application that showcases your skills in full-stack development,
and collaborate on code using Git and GitHub.

### Requirements & Deliverables

- The application must include both client-side and server-side code.
- Ensure the application is fully responsive and works across modern browsers.
- Use Express.js to set up your server and define API endpoints.
- Use SQLite with the better-sqlite3 library for database operations.
- Implement async/await and the Fetch API for non-blocking database operations and API calls.
- Demonstrate an understanding of database design, relationships, and SQL queries.
- A live version of the application, deployed on a platform like Render.
- A GitHub repository containing the source code with a detailed `README.md` about the project.
- A low-fidelity wireframe of the application's layout, ideally created with a tool like Figma or Excalidraw
- A `seed.js` file with SQL commands to set up and seed the database for initial development and testing.
- A brief presentation or document explaining the architecture of your application, the technologies used, and any challenges you faced.

### Our User Stories

As a user, I can:

- Search for a game
- Leave a review
- See other peoples reviews

### Minimum Viable Product

We were aware of scope creep, especially with how extensive the API was and how much we could do for the user with the data. The minimum we needed to do to achieve success in our project was:

- Display games
- Let user click the games
- Let user leave comments
- Comments should display under the game, and display without refreshing the page.

## The Outcome!

### Features!

- Theres's a client, a server and a database!
- The client ...
